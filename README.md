**Imperial College London Physics Degree: Networks Science Project**

Networks science builds predictive models for systems containing non-trivial connections between discrete elements. The models are described by graphs, where nodes represents elements and edges represent connections. A range of physical, biological, and social phenomena can be modelled using networks science, an example of which is the citation network.

This report investigates models of a growing network using various edge attachment strategies: namely pure preferential attachment, pure random attachment, and random walk attachment. Using a comparison of predicted theory against numerical results, the maximum degree trend and degree probability distribution are studied for each attachment method.
